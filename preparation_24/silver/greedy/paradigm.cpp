// greddy is basically, making the most optimal choice at every step, instead of looking at the search space as a whole...
// sometimes, greedy gives incorrect answers (normal!)
// there could be multiple greedy algos for a certain problem, but usually only one of them is correct
// Greedy != Algorithm but Greedy == Way of thinking
// When using greedy, usually there is a heuristic that determines which choice is optimal
