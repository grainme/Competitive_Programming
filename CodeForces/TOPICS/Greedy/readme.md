# Greedy Approach

The Greedy approach is a problem-solving technique that makes locally optimal choices at each step with the aim of achieving a globally optimal solution. It involves making the best possible choice at the current moment without considering future consequences or revisiting previous decisions.

## Steps to apply the Greedy approach:

1. Define the problem and identify the objective or criteria for optimization.
2. Determine the set of choices available at each step.
3. Select the locally optimal choice based on a greedy criterion or heuristic.
4. Update the problem state or constraints based on the chosen option.
5. Repeat steps 2-4 until a solution is found or a termination condition is met.

**Note:** The Greedy approach does not guarantee an optimal solution in every case. It requires careful analysis to ensure the correctness and optimality of the solution.

## Advantages of the Greedy approach:

- Simple implementation.
- Efficiency for certain types of problems.

## Disadvantages of the Greedy approach:

- Does not always yield the globally optimal solution.
- Requires careful consideration of the problem and choice of the greedy criterion.

When applying the Greedy approach, it is important to analyze the problem and assess whether it is suitable and whether it provides the desired results.
