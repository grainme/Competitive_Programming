<h1>Bitwise Operations in Competitive Programming</h1>

- Basic Bitwise Operations like &(AND) and ^(XOR)
- Bitwise Shifts
- Iterating over all 2^N subsets

<p>We can pad some number of 0s to the beginning of the binary representation to make the size equals to the size
of our data type<br>char takes 8 bits and int takes up to 32 bits</p>

- AND :  01 & 11 = 01
- OR  :  01 | 11 = 11
- XOR :  01 ^ 11 = 10
- Left Shift : 01 << 2 = 0100 
<p>
  Left Shifting, if the bit is turned on (==1) and we left shift the binary representation, the value of the bit will increase
  by 2^k as we left shift by k places i will become eventually i+k
<p>
- Right Shift : 0110 << 2 = 01
